  - Embedding or incorporating the Software or Derivative Works in a commercial 
    product or service;
  - Distributing the Software or Derivative Works to third parties for any 
    commercial purpose.

Any commercial use of the Software requires a separate commercial license 
from Lumen Platforms Inc."

The Commons Clause overrides any conflicting provisions of the AGPLv3.
