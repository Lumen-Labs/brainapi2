Plugins can be used to extend the functionality of the BrainAPI.

To add a plugin, add the plugin into the plugins directory and make sure the `brainapi.config.yaml` file is placed into the root of the `plugins` directory.

If you are using a remote plugin add the `<plugin_name>.config.yaml` file directly into the `plugins` directory.
